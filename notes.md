# GRIDZ NOTES

## PLANNING
### MVP
- log in functionality (firebase auth)
- one topster grid per account
- search  Last.fm albums
- place albums into grid
- download the topster as image


### SHORT-TERM
1. add a discrete slider for row/col settings
    - change on-hover for sidebar albums - maybe to a popping outline? 
2. add extra settings
    - rounded corners (slider)
    - gap size by pixels (slider)
    - custom background color (look into rgb popup for users)


### LONG-TERM
1. add hardcoded albums to searchbar
    - add functionality to click album, then it appears in first available empty slot
    - add functionality to drag them in
        - look into "react-dnd" or "dnd-kit"
2. connect to last.fm api and add search functionality
3. make settings tab for dimensions, title(s), background, font


4. connect to firebase and add auth for persistent data
    - topsters will be linked to gmail accounts via firebase auth
5. make multiple topsters possible per account
6. deploy site??

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. export functionality
8. create user profile page
    - user's reviews, lists, and topsters can all be viewed here
9. reviews
    - users can search for an album, and give it a rating from 0-100
10. user album lists
    - lists have albums strung vertically, horizontal space is for user review num + text
11. get friends to make an account :D


## WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT BACKEND + APIs
